# Sample_Selenium_Framework
This is a sample end to end Automation Framework using Selenium WebDriver using Page Object Model design pattern. Data parameterization is achieved using data providers feature of TestNG. Log4j2 is used to capture the test execution logs. Extent Reports is used in conjunction with TestNG Listeners to generate excellent HTML Test Execution Reports. The Framework is thread safe and parallel execution is achieved in the Framework using TestNG. 

### Import the project in eclipse as Maven project
### To run, Right-click on TestNG.xml file and select Run as TestNG Suite.
### Extent HTML report (index.html) can be found under reports folder
### TestNG default report (index.html) can be found under test-output folder
 
# Framework Highlights:
### Parallel execution for distributed execution is achieved using TestNG
### Framework is Thread Safe for parallel execution and reporting.
### Multiple browsers handling for cross-browser testing is achieved using WebDriver Manager.
### Log4j2 is used to capture the test execution logs

# Further Improvements:
### JIRA API integration to update the results in JIRA after the test execution.
### The Framework can be integrated with Continuous Integration tool like Jenkins/Bamboo for CI/CD pipeline.
